# transfer-sheet-calculator
<p>I made this tool to for working with heat transfer labels in screen printing. It can be used to calculate the minimum amount of transfer sheets to be printed to fulfill a job.

<h3>Input</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Label dimensions</li>
    <li>Quantity of garments in the job you're printing</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Output</h3>

    <li>Ratio of label sizes per sheet</li>
    <li>Minimum number of sheets that need to be printed to fulfill the job</li>
  </ul>
